    "# Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "__Object-oriented programming (OOP)__ is one of the most effective approaches to writing software. In object-oriented programming, you write classes that represent real-world things and situations, and you create objects based on these classes. When you write a class, you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   When you create individual objects from the class, each object is automatically equipped with the general behavior; you can then give each object whatever unique traits you desire. You’ll be amazed how well real-world situations can be modeled with object-oriented programming.\n",
    "-   Making an object from a class is called **_instantiation_**, and you work with instances of a class. In this chapter you’ll write classes and create instances of those classes. You’ll specify the kind of information that can be stored in instances, and you’ll define actions that can be taken with these instances. You’ll also write classes that extend the functionality of existing classes, so similar classes can share common functionality, and you can do more with less code. You’ll store your classes in modules and import classes written by other programmers into your own program files.\n",
    "-   Learning about object-oriented programming will help you see the world as a programmer does. It’ll help you understand your code—not just what’s happening line by line, but also the bigger concepts behind it. Knowing the logic behind classes will train you to think logically, so you can write programs that effectively address almost any problem you encounter.\n",
    "-   Classes also make life easier for you and the other programmers you’ll work with as you take on increasingly complex challenges. When you and other programmers write code based on the same kind of logic, you’ll be able to understand each other’s work. Your programs will make sense to the people you work with, allowing everyone to accomplish more."
