    "When you write a function or a class, you can also write tests for that code. Testing proves that your code works as it’s supposed to in response to all the kinds of input it’s designed to receive. When you write tests, you can be confident that your code will work correctly as more people begin to use your programs. You’ll also be able to test new code as you add it, to make sure your changes don’t break your program’s existing behavior. Every programmer makes mistakes, so every programmer must test their code often, to catch problems before users encounter them."

Python doesn’t include pytest by default, so you’ll learn to install external libraries. Knowing how to install external libraries will make a wide variety of well-designed code available to you. These libraries will expand the kinds of projects you can work on immensely."
