    "-   A **relative file path** tells Python to look for a given location relative to the directory where the currently running program file is stored. Since text_files is inside python_work, we need to build a path that starts with   the directory text_files, and ends with the filename. Here’s how to build this path:\n",
    "`path = Path('text_files/filename.txt')`\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You can also tell Python exactly where the file is on your computer, regardless of where the program that’s being executed is stored. This is called an **absolute file path**. You can use an absolute path if a relative path doesn’t work. For instance, if you’ve put text_files in some folder other than python_work, then just passing Path the path 'text_files/filename.txt' won’t work because Python will only look for that location inside python_work. You’ll need to write out an absolute path to clarify where you want Python to look.\n",
    "Absolute paths are usually longer than relative paths, because they start at your system’s root folder:\n",
    "`path = Path('/home/eric/data_files/text_files/filename.txt')`\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Using absolute paths, you can read files from any location on your system. For now it’s easiest to store files in the same directory as your program files, or in a folder such as text_files within the directory that stores your program files.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Windows systems use a backslash `(\\)` instead of a forward slash `(/)` when displaying file paths, but you should use forward slashes in your code, even on Windows. The pathlib library will automatically use the correct representation of the path when it interacts with your system, or any user’s system."
