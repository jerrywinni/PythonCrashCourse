    "-   A **relative file path** tells Python to look for a given location relative to the directory where the currently running program file is stored. Since text_files is inside python_work, we need to build a path that starts with   the directory text_files, and ends with the filename. Here’s how to build this path:\n",
    "`path = Path('text_files/filename.txt')`\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You can also tell Python exactly where the file is on your computer, regardless of where the program that’s being executed is stored. This is called an **absolute file path**. You can use an absolute path if a relative path doesn’t work. For instance, if you’ve put text_files in some folder other than python_work, then just passing Path the path 'text_files/filename.txt' won’t work because Python will only look for that location inside python_work. You’ll need to write out an absolute path to clarify where you want Python to look.\n",
    "Absolute paths are usually longer than relative paths, because they start at your system’s root folder:\n",
    "`path = Path('/home/eric/data_files/text_files/filename.txt')`\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Using absolute paths, you can read files from any location on your system. For now it’s easiest to store files in the same directory as your program files, or in a folder such as text_files within the directory that stores your program files.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Windows systems use a backslash `(\\)` instead of a forward slash `(/)` when displaying file paths, but you should use forward slashes in your code, even on Windows. The pathlib library will automatically use the correct representation of the path when it interacts with your system, or any user’s system."

    "Many of your programs will ask users to input certain kinds of information. You might allow users to store preferences in a game or provide data for a visualization. Whatever the focus of your program is, you’ll store the information users provide in data structures such as lists and dictionaries. When users close a program, you’ll almost always want to save the information they entered. A simple way to do this involves storing your data using the `json` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `json` module allows you to convert simple Python data structures into JSON-formatted strings, and then load the data from that file the next time the program runs. You can also use json to share data between different Python programs. Even better, the JSON data format is not specific to Python, so you can share data you store in the JSON format with people who work in many other programming languages. It’s a useful and portable format, and it’s easy to learn.\n",
